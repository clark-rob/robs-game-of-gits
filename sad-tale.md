House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

He will totally die.

Joffrey cuts his head clean off because Joffrey wants the world to hate him and his dumb childlike face.
